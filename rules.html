    <p><h1>CompeGuitar Game Rules</h1></p>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The goal of the game is to correctly identify the positions of musical notes on a guitar fretboard for various scales.</p>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the "Got Skills?" button on the main page to begin.</li>
            <li>Once the game starts, a random musical scale will be selected, </li>
            <li> you will be prompted to identify the note positions for that scale.</li>
            <li>Click on the fret buttons to select the correct notes on the guitar fretboard.</li>
            <li>If you select a correct note, it will be highlighted in green, and your score will increase by 10 points.</li>
            <li>If you select an incorrect note, it will be highlighted in red for a brief moment, and your score will decrease by 5 points.</li>
            <li>Continue selecting the correct notes until all notes for the current scale are identified. A new round will then start with a different scale.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <p>Your score is based on the number of correct notes you identify:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Correct note: +10 points</li>
            <li>Incorrect note: -5 points</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Timer</h2>
        <p>You have about 60 seconds to identify as many correct notes as possible.</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>The timer will start as soon as the game begins.</li>
            <li>Time runs faster when you don't play.</li>
            <li>But when acomplished 2 scales you go up a level and timer resets.</li>
            <li>When the timer reaches zero, the game is over, and your final score will be displayed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Familiarize yourself with the scales and their note positions before starting the game.</li>
            <li>Try to be quick but accurate in identifying the notes to maximize your score.</li>
        </ul>
